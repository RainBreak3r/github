					<description><![CDATA[Hands down, the absolute worst and inaccurate article about both Ripple and XRP that I&#039;ve ever read, and probably has ever been written. The author clearly hasn&#039;t done any research, and whatever research he did do, is incorrect. Chris, you should be ashamed of yourself for churning out this nonsense.]]></description>

xRapid and xVia still say &quot;Request early access&quot;. I can&#039;t post that these products exist based on promises. They need to be active. I would be happy to reference them once they&#039;re available. I look for links on the website that can be easily found to provide customer support. There&#039;s literally no way to communicate with them from a standard users point of view. If somebody has questions about what Ripple (XRP) is or has a question, the first place they&#039;re going to look is the Ripple.com website. All that needs too be done is a producing a link to a community forum or hire somebody to answer emails. Ripples customers are not the standard users, but the standard users supply an important part to the Ripple ecosystem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why did you say they only have xCurrent, when they also have xRapid, xVia... and in the future xPool? Also.. &quot;customer support?&quot;.. does bitcoin have &quot;customer support?&quot; Do you email satoshi himself? Ripples customers are the purchasers of their software.]]></description>

Andrew, unfortunately negative views aren&#039;t popular ones. All I&#039;m doing is referencing information that&#039; publicly available. The rating is based on a set of pre-defined conditions that I have no control over. Ripple is the only company that has scored a 0 on customer support. Billions and they can&#039;t hire somebody to answer emails?]]></description>
