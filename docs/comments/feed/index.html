					<description><![CDATA[Hands down, the absolute worst and inaccurate article about both Ripple and XRP that I&#039;ve ever read, and probably has ever been written. The author clearly hasn&#039;t done any research, and whatever research he did do, is incorrect. Chris, you should be ashamed of yourself for churning out this nonsense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great coin. HUGE future in this one. In a years time this coin will easily be $500+ at minimum. This coin fixes many issues with Bitcoin and other popular cryptos with the added benefit 100% untraceable transactions for privacy if needed. This coin is the future, just wait and see. I am buying up a TON of BitcoinPrivate right now at these super low prices while all the post-fork dumpers/people panicking in this bear market sell, its great! Big exchanges are in the works, this coin is only going to get better over time. One of the strongest teams in all of crypto for sure.]]></description>

Also.. &quot;customer support?&quot;.. does bitcoin have &quot;customer support?&quot; Do you email satoshi himself? Ripples customers are the purchasers of their software.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We strongly disagree with the 2 of 10 for support!  Bitcointalk and Just-Dice.com chat are world class support from some really smart folks.  

CLAM entry level running your own wallet isn&#039;t for beginners, but the easy to use faucet is a wonderful combo for any website that accepts CLAM.... the faucet really allow users to get a good solid taste of what crypto is.]]></description>

xRapid and xVia still say &quot;Request early access&quot;. I can&#039;t post that these products exist based on promises. They need to be active. I would be happy to reference them once they&#039;re available. I look for links on the website that can be easily found to provide customer support. There&#039;s literally no way to communicate with them from a standard users point of view. If somebody has questions about what Ripple (XRP) is or has a question, the first place they&#039;re going to look is the Ripple.com website. All that needs too be done is a producing a link to a community forum or hire somebody to answer emails. Ripples customers are not the standard users, but the standard users supply an important part to the Ripple ecosystem.]]></description>
