					<description><![CDATA[Great coin. HUGE future in this one. In a years time this coin will easily be $500+ at minimum. This coin fixes many issues with Bitcoin and other popular cryptos with the added benefit 100% untraceable transactions for privacy if needed. This coin is the future, just wait and see. I am buying up a TON of BitcoinPrivate right now at these super low prices while all the post-fork dumpers/people panicking in this bear market sell, its great! Big exchanges are in the works, this coin is only going to get better over time. One of the strongest teams in all of crypto for sure.]]></description>

I&#039;m with you buddy. I&#039;ve made great returns on crypto-trading but the reality is there&#039;s no returns that will be greater than this coin when it hits the main markets. I&#039;m actually pulling side jobs right now just to buy more BTCP. Liquid-wise I&#039;m broke! LOL. I actually bought in at $60 and now it&#039;s dropped. But, I didn&#039;t want to be greedy and miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime. It doesn&#039;t even matter because this coin is going to explode. I&#039;ve even contacted friends and family to give them a chance. Unfortunately only certain types of people are meant to be risk takers :/]]></description>

I try and do my ratings as the view from a person that&#039;s not techy and new to the crypto environment. They need an installer. The full node wallet requires the user to use Java which isn&#039;t feasible for average users. Also, the windows file should be a .zip for windows users. Having to use 3rd party tools to extract is wrong.]]></description>
