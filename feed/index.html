										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>NEO Website: <a href="https://neo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Home Page</a></h3>



<h3>Overview:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://github.altcoinandme.com/altcoin-list/thumbsdown/"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsDown-150x150.jpg" alt="I do not recommend this cryptocurrency" class="wp-image-101"/></a><figcaption>View the ScoreSheet <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlo62HA5WYSqeDj4fw0AVT4dDm_XidInQpWBuwe2z9U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>:</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>NEO is often termed as the &#8220;Chinese <a href="http://altcoinandme.azurewebsites.net/ethereum-eth-cryptocurrency-review/">Ethereum</a>&#8220;. The reason people refer to this reference is because NEO provides &#8220;smart contracts&#8221; which are an ability for developers to implement applications within the network giving it potential to be whatever the programmers can think up. Another similarity is the transaction fees being covered by &#8220;gas&#8221; which is the amount needed to perform a transaction and is a completely separate cryptocurrency by itself. The main difference is that developers are able to develop in a programming language of their choice on the NEO network which is a big deal. The throughput is also impressive at 1000 practical (not theoretical) transactions per second.</p>



<h3>Personal Opinion:</h3>



<p>This is one of the most difficult ratings I&#8217;ve given since at the beginning of my research I discovered that I had the ability to develop in my native programming language (C#). However, the truth is NEO isn&#8217;t a fully decentralized network. The main reason for the throughput is because they only cover part of the requirements for a decentralized network. This is actually the reason why NEO is able to achieve such throughput. They don&#8217;t hide this fact and have stated they plan on decentralization in the future.&nbsp;<a href="http://altcoinandme.azurewebsites.net/ripple-xrp-cryptocurrency-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See my Ripple Review on centralization.</a> Supporting a cryptocurrency that isn&#8217;t fully decentralized is like saying &#8220;I have full trust my government will do the right thing and not intervene&#8221;. The fact that the nodes are based in China is also scary since the Chinese government is known for its censorship policies.</p>



<p>Also very disheartening (taken from their whitepaper):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate NEO developers and members of the NEO Council</p><p>10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate developers in the NEO ecosystem</p><p>15 million tokens (15% total) will be used to cross-invest in other block-chain projects, which are owned by the NEO Council and are used only for NEO projects</p><p>15 million (15% total) will be retained as contingency&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Given their amount of self-distribution or control violates the concept of any one entity containing too much power. This is a huge negative flag and should be taken seriously. It&#8217;s not as awful as <a href="http://altcoinandme.azurewebsites.net/ripple-xrp-cryptocurrency-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ripples distribution</a>&nbsp;of currency however it&#8217;s still a major problem. It encourages the self interest of the party in control and not the community.</p>



<h3>Usability (7/10):</h3>



<p>If you would like to get started quickly with NEOs on a PC I would recommend clicking <a href="#PcSetup">here to scroll</a> down to the &#8220;PC Online / LightWeight Setup&#8221; section. To quickly setup on your phone <a href="#PhoneSetup">click here to scroll down</a> to the phone setup section. Unfortunately the full node doesn&#8217;t include an installer but it pretty straightforward. It took three days to synchronize with the network which is pretty good.</p>



<h3>Privacy (5/10):</h3>



<p>NEO uses a standard [sg_popup id=&#8221;33&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]block-chain[/sg_popup] public ledger that&#8217;s fully transparent. This has obvious benefits but there&#8217;s no apparent privacy enhancing features of NEO.</p>



<h3>Credibility (10/10):</h3>



<p>Congratulations to the NEO team for getting a 10/10 which is very rare for the cryptocurrencies I review. A full roster of the team can be located <a href="https://neo.org/home/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. If you would like to do your own reading of the documentation (whitepaper) it is located <a href="http://docs.neo.org/en-us/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The code of the project is fully transparent and can be found by navigating <a href="https://github.com/neo-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Innovation (10/10):</h3>



<p>Neo has shown great innovation particularly in the field of enabling any programming language to run on its platform. NEO also contains some trendsetting features labeled&nbsp;NeoFX, NeoFS and NeoQS. For the simplicity of this review I will not be expanding on these topics.</p>



<h3>Customer Support (5.25/10):</h3>



<p>Customer support wasn&#8217;t the best but it does exist. There&#8217;s a couple Chinese support forums that I was unable to evaluate due to not supporting English. If you have a basic question and speak English I would recommend the Neos community <a href="https://discord.gg/DtzSb2Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord chat</a>. The chat can be a hit or miss so you may need to call out an admin to get an answer. For questions you can&#8217;t resolve within the community Neo an email is listed at contact@neo.org which I got a response from within 24 hours. The Facebook messaging doesn&#8217;t work and getting a response from reddit can be a gamble.</p>



<h3>Exchange Support (10/10):</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t locate any of the exchanges on the website however NEO was able to make the points up with the large amount of support across exchanges. Here&#8217;s a list according to CoinMarketCap.com in order from the highest volume to the lowest volume:&nbsp;UpBit, Binance, Bitfinex, OKEx, CoinEgg, Bittrex, Huobi, LbankLBank, DragonEx, HitBTC.</p>



<h3 id="WalletSetup">Getting started &#8211; Wallet Usability (7/10):</h3>



<p>The development community has developed many different versions on NEO. Several full and lightweight PC versions are located <a href="https://neo.org/client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. They don&#8217;t list phone app versions on the website but I&#8217;ve included some below.</p>



<h3 id="PhoneSetup">Phone Setup</h3>



<h5>Android:</h5>



<p>I chose to download and use a wallet by the name of O3Wallet <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.o3.o3wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">located here</a>. Click &#8220;Create a new wallet&#8221; on the first screen after installation. The next screen will display a public address and a private key. The public address is an address you can give out to receive your funds. Don&#8217;t ever disclose your private address to anybody! The private address is the key to unlock your account. Write it down on a piece of paper and hide it. Screenshots are not recommended because if a person gains access to your photos they essentially will gain access to your wallet.</p>



<h5>iPhone:</h5>



<p>None found.</p>



<h3 id="PcSetup">PC Setup:</h3>



<h5>Online wallet / Light Weight Wallet:</h5>



<p>Download a lightweight wallet by &#8220;CityOfZion&#8221; for Windows or Linux located <a href="https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-wallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Click on &#8220;Create a new wallet&#8221; on the next screen or use another one of the options to login. Choose a password and select &#8220;Generate Keys&#8221;. Make sure to copy the information on the next screen in the situation that you may need to recover your wallet. After you are done saving the information the only method I could personally view to start the wallet was to close the window, double click on the application on your desktop. Click on &#8220;login using a saved wallet&#8221;. Select your wallet then enter the passphrase. You now have full access to your wallet, Congratulations!</p>



<h5>Download a Full Node Wallet (Witness node or Full Wallet):</h5>



<p>The full node PC wallet for Windows is available for download by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/neo-project/neo-gui/releases/download/v2.6.0/neo-gui-windows.zip">here</a>. Open the zip file and drag and drop the folder your desktop. Next, double click on &#8220;neo-gui.exe&#8221; inside of the folder. Click &#8220;yes&#8221; on installing the certificate and your wallet will automatically start downloading the blocks.</p>



<h5>Free NEO Faucets:</h5>



<p>No obvious faucets could be found.&nbsp;This is because the minimum amount of NEO that can be transferred from wallet to wallet is 1 so the faucet would have to pay out 1 NEO per interaction which is a very large amount.</p>

<h3>Steem Website: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://steem.com/" target="_blank">Project Home Page</a></h3>



<h3>Overview:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsUp-150x150.jpg" alt="Approved" class="wp-image-99"/><figcaption>Recommended &#8211; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-i_3n4xPTEK7MEos7mZFSACIzJQMOt70B8crmpMXj4I/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Score Sheet</a>!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Steem is a [sg_popup id=&#8221;33&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]blockchain[/sg_popup] based social media network. The website SteemIt.com is the primary website that utilizes steem. Contributions towards the SteemIt network are primarily distributed to the authors and curators. Steem actually consists of three currency components.</p>



<ol><li>The primary currency is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steem</span>&nbsp;which can be transferred anytime to anyone and can be converted to Steem power within your SteemIt wallet account.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steem power (SP)</span> is similar to holding stock in a company. It gives your votes more weight. If you wish to cash out SP it takes 13 weeks and each payment is exactly 1/13 of your balance.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lastly, Steem Dollars (SD)</span> are pegged to the US dollar on a $1 to 1 SD conversion. This is not always the case, but they do their best to accomplish this through economic incentives referenced in their whitepaper.</li></ol>



<h3>Personal Opinion:</h3>



<p>I live in a country where we are taught that we have &#8220;free speech&#8221; unless you say something unpopular on Twitter or Facebook which will lead to your content being removed or possible legal ramifications. The Steem [sg_popup id=&#8221;33&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]blockchain[/sg_popup] negates this by making all posted material publicly available. I will note that SteemIt.com (a branch of steem) does censor their content which is understandable considering the aforementioned repercussions. I believe we are only in the infancy stage of this product and I personally plan to shift a good part of my crypto portfolio to STEEM in the future. It will be very interesting to see how this project evolves in the future but I believe the investment is worth supporting the ideals of this project.</p>



<h3>Usability (7/10):</h3>



<p>If you would like to get started fast, I would recommend you use the website &#8220;SteemIt.com&#8221;. <a href="#WalletSetup">To get started click here to scroll down to the setup instructions</a>. It provides everything you need including social media integration. To start a lightweight wallet as a desktop client &#8220;Vessel&#8221; was somewhat easy to use once you set the right server setup as <a href="#LightWeightSetup">explained blow</a>. The initial comprehension of the three different elements of Steem can be confusing for beginners. The website is lacking links to some of the components to get you started. Contributing computing power to a full node wallet or witness is too complicated for a new users. I would highly recommend sticking to the lightweight wallet. The transactional capacity of Steem is impressive at 10,000 transactions per second should the future require it.</p>



<h3>Privacy (5/10):</h3>



<p>Steem uses a standard [sg_popup id=&#8221;33&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]block-chain[/sg_popup] public ledger that&#8217;s fully transparent. This has obvious benefits but there&#8217;s no apparent privacy enhancing features of Steem.</p>



<h3>Credibility (7.5/10):</h3>



<p>Steem clearly has some brilliant people behind it but they were very difficult to locate from the home page with-ought doing a google search. Listing the team helps add trust in the public eye. Hopefully a member of the team will read this review and add a link on the home page. The information seems to be spread sporadically across the internet, however I was able to locate the company LinkedIn page <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2210498384%22%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Innovation (10/10):</h3>



<p>After reading through the whitepaper it&#8217;s very clear that the developers designed this product with every predicted scenario and consideration in mind. All of the promotion that I personally encountered for steem was towards earning rewards for contributions towards the network. However, I believe the most revolutionary aspect of this product is the inability of governments or corporations to censor the content. Any and all contributions posted to the steem network will reside on the public ledger as long as the network is operational.</p>



<h3>Customer Support (5.25/10):</h3>



<p>There were some strong points and some weak points of the community customer support. I was able to make direct contact with one of the developers via Email which by itself is very rare. To immediately reach customer support go to the SteemIt chat <a href="https://steem.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Discord was equally effective in receiving support. To join the Discord chat <a href="https://discord.gg/B29Bbng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>. I was unable to receive support on any of the other channels listed on the home page.</p>



<h3>Exchange Support (10/10):</h3>



<p>The easiest way to obtain additional Steem if you already own another cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is to convert your coins at blocktrades.us by <a href="https://blocktrades.us/?input_coin_type=btc&amp;output_coin_type=steem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clicking here</a>. The available centralized exchanges listed on the website are Bittrex and Poloniex, however you can pick up Steem on almost any exchange. Exchanges not listed on the website listed in higher to lower volume according to coinmarketcap.com are as follows: UpBit, Binance, GoPax, HitBTC, BuyUCoin and VeBitCoin.</p>



<h3 id="WalletSetup">Getting started:</h3>



<p>The first thing you&#8217;re going to want to do is to navigate to the SteemIt <a href="https://signup.steemit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signup form my clicking here</a>. Make sure to verify your email address and phone number. After the team reviews your information you will need to wait for verification. Personally, it took five days for my account to be validated however I&#8217;ve been told that it typically only takes a day or two. The customer support indicated that this is to make sure there&#8217;s no impostors pretending to be somebody they&#8217;re not.</p>



<h3>Phone Setup</h3>



<h5>Android:</h5>



<p>There&#8217;s a free nifty little program called SteemPay that you can use to send SBD or STEEM. It&#8217;s available for download from the google play store&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodaxx.steempay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Once you download the program, use your SteemIt.com login credentials to access the application.</p>



<h5>iPhone:</h5>



<p>None found.</p>



<h3>PC Setup:</h3>



<h5>Online wallet / Light Weight Wallet:</h5>



<p>The simplest way to use a Steem wallet is to use the wallet allocated to you on Steemit.com. Your account name (in my case altcoinandme) is your actual wallet address. Pretty simple right! You can transfer to and from your wallet Steem Power, Steem and Steem dollars. If you need to transfer from an exchange, they may also require you to have a &#8220;memo field&#8221; that you can locate by clicking on your profile photo in the top right hand corner. Next click on &#8220;Wallet&#8221; and then permissions. You will see the memo address listed on the bottom. <span id="LightWeightSetup"></span>Another alternative that gives you a great overview and control of your assets is a product called &#8220;Vessel&#8221; which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/aaroncox/vessel/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I did encounter some issues with vessel connecting. If you encounter the same issue, I resolved it by clicking on &#8220;Change server&#8221; at the top. The server that I found to work was &#8220;https://steemd.minnowsupportproject.org&#8221;.</p>



<h5>Download a Full Node Wallet (Witness node or Full Wallet):</h5>



<p>Unfortunately, the current method to setup a witness node is extremely complex and requires an extremely high amount of computer resources. The engineers purposely designed the architecture to allocate a large amount of computer memory to ensure network throughput. The current recommended amount of RAM required is 64 GB. If you would still like to proceed I would recommend installing docker CE free edition by <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clicking here</a>.</p>



<p>Once you register, docker will appear in the toolbar on the bottom right hand side. Right click on the&nbsp; docker and select &#8220;Kitematic&#8221;. Download the zip file and extract it to a folder on your desktop. Open the folder and double click on the Kitematic.exe file. You will see an image created by &#8220;teego&#8221;. Click on create and wait for the image to download. Once the image is downloaded click on the container on the left hand side then click on start. You will see the wallet come online with some errors. Now comes the complicated part. You will need to fine tune the config.ini file to optimize your image. This file can be found in: &#8220;C:\Users\{Your User Name}\Documents\Kitematic\steem-wallet\witness_node_data_dir&#8221;.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an example server config.ini file is located <a href="https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/contrib/fullnode.config.ini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You may need to manually adjust a lot of the parameters to get the image to work therefore disabling or enabling the plugins is a good place to start. Lastly, being compensated for being a witness can be difficult since witnesses are voted on by the public which means consequently you will need a high speed, reliable internet connection and high end hardware to appear on the community radar. There&#8217;s a list of the top witnesses getting paid <a href="https://steemd.com/witnesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I&#8217;ve also been informed by the developers there&#8217;s no compensation for the actual mining of the blocks, only compensation for serving as a witness node.</p>



<h5>Free Steem Faucets:</h5>



<p>No obvious faucets could be found</p>

<h3>Ethereum Website: <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Home Page</a></h3>



<h3>Overview:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsUp-150x150.jpg" alt="Approved" class="wp-image-99"/><figcaption>Recommended &#8211; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qCzyysjsOh2yzjvbOZoYboOv3fQ6mwtg95X9r9l3nM8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Score Sheet!</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Ethereum is a platform that provides the tools necessary for developers to innovate applications on the top of its network. Ethereum has strong community support that has made major contributions to the evolution of this project.</p>



<h3>Personal Opinion:</h3>



<p>Ethereum has been a pioneer in its field and has a bright future. The primary developer of Ethereum is a man by the name of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitalik Buterin</a>&nbsp;that is solely focused on&nbsp;benefiting humanity and not financial profits. I firmly believe that it&#8217;s these beliefs that will pave the way for the future. Vitalik has set down a roadmap for the next few years that will lead to a lot of market innovation but it will undoubtedly cause some market instability. Unfortunately, the price of Ethereum has boomed in the previous year so it&#8217;s currently very expensive to purchase. If you decide to invest it should be viewed as a long term investment in the ideals of Ethereum and not for profit. This isn&#8217;t to say that it won&#8217;t be profitable but if market volatility causes you a lot of stress you should stay away.</p>



<h3>Ethereum Website:</h3>



<p><a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Page</a></p>



<h3>Whitepaper (documentation):</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Paper</a></p>



<h3>Usability (9/10):</h3>



<p>I was able to sync properly at high speeds but the program seemed to hang a bit at startup while &#8220;looking for peers&#8221;. Be patient and it will eventually come online. Due to the popularity, there&#8217;s a large amount of available applications. The primary PC client for Windows and Linux are available on their <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a>.</p>



<p>There is a lightweight version of the wallet inside of the main application. It&#8217;s not truly lightweight in the sense that there is a small amount of hardware that&#8217;s needed but overall it&#8217;s great. If you would like to setup a wallet on your PC, <a href="#WalletSetup">click here to scroll down</a> for instructions on setting up a wallet on your computer. If you would like to setup the wallet on your phone <a href="#PhoneSetup">click here to scroll down</a> to the phone setup section.</p>



<h3>Privacy (5/10):</h3>



<p>Although privacy seems to be on the forefront of the next implementations of Ethereum it currently only comes with standard privacy. There is currently a project called ZoKrates that has been able to implement a technology called [sg_popup id=&#8221;24&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]zkSnarks[/sg_popup] to provide anonymous transactions. I was able to contact the lead developer of the project (Jacob Ebert). Here&#8217;s a description of ZoKrates in his own words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hi Chris, <a href="https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/ZoKrates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZoKrates</a> is a research project I am working on. It also has community contributors and an active gitter community. It can be used to implement zkSnarks on Ethereum. We are working on adding more features and improving usability so these applications can become more powerful, performant and easier to use.</p></blockquote>



<p>Clearly this project has a bright future with the ongoing efforts of Jacob and the community. As Jacob mentioned it&#8217;s very difficult to implement and is only feasible for advanced users. ZoKrates is working to make the process easier for mass adoption. If you would like to contribute to the development of ZoKrates the homepage is listed here: <a href="https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/ZoKrates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZoKrates</a>.</p>



<h3>Credibility (10/10):</h3>



<p>The listed Ethereum team is small but there are large amounts of programmers contributing across the globe. It&#8217;s very easy to research Vitalik and his knowledge by searching for Vitalik Buterin on YouTube or by&nbsp;clicking here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vitalik+buterin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search YouTube</a>. If you would like to view the team listed on the website&nbsp;click here: <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Team.</a>&nbsp;Everything with Ethereum has been and will be open source which enables the contribution of programmers across the globe. If you would like to contribute to the development of Ethereum their official GitHub page is located here: <a href="https://github.com/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: inherit; font-size: 2.0345em;">Innovation (10/10):</span></p>



<p>Ethereum has not only set the bar for other crypto-currencies but has created a structure to enable them to succeed. This currency may become the next big thing simply due to the fact that it&#8217;s constantly evolving to add technological improvements.</p>



<h3>Customer Support (6/10):</h3>



<p>It should be noted that although they scored a 6 out of 10, the customer support that I did receive was the best I&#8217;ve received yet. They are the only currency so far that has an operational chat box on their home page where you can receive immediate support. If you need support, <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>&nbsp;then click on the chat box in the bottom right hand corner. The next best option is to post your question to the community forum. The forum can be found here: <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackExchange</a>. I was unable to locate a customer support email address on the website and I did not receive a response on the Ethereum Reddit page.</p>



<h3>Exchange Support (10/10):</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, the exchanges are difficult to find on the website. They are linked on the home page through the documentation but it&#8217;s very difficult to locate. Luckily for Ethereum, they scored a 10 simply because of the large amount of exchanges available. Hopefully a developer at Ethereum will read through this review and make the changes.</p>



<p>The list of popular exchanges can be found here: <a href="http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ether.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanges</a>. The exchanges listed in order are Poloniex, Kraken, Gatecoin, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bluetrade, HitBTC, LiveCoin, Coinsquare and Bittylicious.</p>



<h3 id="WalletSetup">Wallet Setup Instructions (8/10):</h3>



<p>The PC version is located directly on the home page however if you would like to setup Ethereum on a phone you will find it in the app store. The team has introduced an installer in the beta version however this version isn&#8217;t the the main download listed on the website.</p>



<h5 id="PhoneSetup">iPhone and Android Users:</h5>



<p>The easiest way to get started is to search the app store for an application named &#8220;Ethereum wallet by FreeWallet. Sign in with an email address or a social media account. If you would like a tutorial on how to use the application click on &#8220;Explore your wallet&#8221; within the app.</p>



<h5>PC Users:</h5>



<p>Create a folder on your desktop and label it &#8220;Ethereum&#8221;. Next, download the zip file located here: <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/download/v0.10.0/Ethereum-Wallet-win32-0-10-0.zip">Wallet Download</a>. Open the file and press &#8220;ctrl + a&#8221; inside the window. Now, drag and drop the contents to the folder you created on the desktop.</p>



<p>Open the folder and double click on the icon labeled &#8220;Ethereum Wallet&#8221;. By default the application is set to &#8220;light mode&#8221; which synchronizes fast but you will need to wait until the &#8220;downloading blocks&#8221; screen disappears. Now that you&#8217;re inside the app, feel free to click around and explore.<br>Note: If you would like to experiment with the beta version with an installer <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/download/v0.10.0/Ethereum-Wallet-installer-0-10-0.exe">click here</a>.</p>



<h5>Online wallets:</h5>



<p><a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyEtherWallet</a> is one of the most common online wallets. I&#8217;ve included a video below to explain how to setup an easy lightweight Ethereum account.<br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/phht73IvUDI?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Ripple Website: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank">Project Home Page</a></h3>



<h3>Opinion:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsDown-150x150.jpg" alt="I do not recommend this cryptocurrency" class="wp-image-101"/><figcaption>Not recommended &#8211; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ZWqgux_UeRgRNeSEx-QJCy2SncNaBTMbd5DXxlUX4Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Score Sheet!</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For this article I will be referring to Ripple and XRP interchangeably since the control Ripple has over XRP is undeniable. I approached this crypto-currency with an open mind as I do with all of my evaluations. Unfortunately, they scored the lowest on customer support of any crypto-currency I&#8217;ve rated yet so obtaining credible non-bias information was difficult. Here&#8217;s the facts: The &#8220;genius&#8221; programmers didn&#8217;t create Ripple.&nbsp;A real &#8220;genius&#8221; Canadian engineer named &#8220;Ryan Fugger&#8221; was the creator, not the current Ripple company. I was honored to establish direct contact with Ryan and he gave me permission to post his response to my questions. You can view Ryans inspirational email by [sg_popup id=&#8221;17&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]clicking here![/sg_popup]. Out of respect for Ryan, I won&#8217;t be disclosing any part of our conversation outside of the email above. Ironically between the week I spent researching and writing this article and the publication date the executive below is no longer listed under the leadership of the company. The assumed former executive chairman at Ripple describes Ryans project here:<br><code><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zW_DN9pkbM?rel=0&amp;start=15" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></code></p>



<p>The only product Ripple has created is a product they call &#8220;xCurrent&#8221; which is nothing more than proprietary software that banks can use to verify transactions over the ledger. Ripple is distributing 1 billion XRP to themselves monthly for 55 months. Don&#8217;t believe me? Watch the video below:</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7fDEO15MGI?rel=0&amp;start=56" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p>They claim it&#8217;s to provide &#8220;supply predictability&#8221;. If Ripple were to sell 55 billion at once it would be worth almost nothing. That&#8217;s maximizing profits not obtaining supply predictability since Ripple can distribute or hold as much as they want under one billion XRP a month. At the time of this writing that&#8217;s valued around 500 million USD a month. I&#8217;m a firm believer in the free market but when you&#8217;re abusing the brilliant work of free thinkers for monetary gain you should be exiled from being labeled anything but &#8220;Ripple Bank&#8221;. Look at Ripples team and ask yourself whether you see a development team or a bank:&nbsp;<a href="https://ripple.com/company/leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Team</a>.</p>



<h5>Technical issues with Ripple:</h5>



<p>Ripples main claim to fame is their transaction throughput, however if you dig into their &#8220;consensus algorithm&#8221; and architecture you&#8217;ll learn that it handles only part of the conditions required for a decentralized network. If you believe you are going to run a trusted node to contribute, don&#8217;t waste your time. First of all, you will receive no compensation. Secondly, you can get flagged as untrusted for something as simple as a network interruption. Ripple of course is operating the mass majority of the XRP nodes and if you finished watching the video above they&#8217;re planning on adding more in 2018.</p>



<p>The transaction throughput is possible because XRP is metaphorically nothing more than a centralized source of Ripple server databases. Anybody that has access to the internet can obtain the same throughput through the readily available cloud services of Amazon, Microsoft or Google. In the end the only positive contribution of Ripple has been marketing the mass adoption of crypto-currencies.</p>



<h3>Ripple Whitepaper (documentation):</h3>



<p><a href="https://ripple.com/files/ripple_solutions_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhitePaper</a></p>



<h3>Usability:</h3>



<p>Third party applications are available that are extremely easy to use, however they aren&#8217;t listed directly on the Ripple website. If you would simply like to setup your wallet as a new user I would recommend you <a href="#WalletSetup">click here to scroll down</a> to the section titled &#8220;Wallet Setup Instructions&#8221;. For the more advanced users that would like to setup a full node to help support the ripple network, <a href="#NodeSetup">click here to scroll down</a> to the section on running a full node. Ripple refers to their nodes as &#8220;validators&#8221; and there is detailed documentation on how to set it up but it&#8217;s extremely complicated and should be reserved for advanced users only.</p>



<h3>Privacy:</h3>



<p>Nothing special here, they use a public ledger which is about the only resemblance they have to crypto-currencies.</p>



<h3>Credibility:</h3>



<p>The Ripple team is fully transparent and consists of 15 people including executives, marketers, legal council, sales, compliance officers, finance specialists, public relations and developers. A full list of the team is located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://ripple.com/company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company team</a>. The code is also open source and located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ripple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Project.</a></p>



<h3>Innovation:</h3>



<p>Ripple has created a &#8220;consensus algorithm&#8221; which theoretically allows XRP to handle 1500 transactions per second.&nbsp;Ripple also produces their own software by the name of &#8220;xCurrent&#8221; that enables banks to settle transactions in four seconds internationally. The software combined with the low transaction costs has led to the adoption of many banks worldwide.</p>



<h3>Customer Support:</h3>



<p>Non-existent. I attempted to contact Ripple over Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn with no response. The email address listed on on the website is support@ripple.com. An immediate auto-reply from the email address will tell you to email another address. I attempted to email the other address twice with two completely different questions. I received the exact canned response twice to read online articles which had nothing to do with my question.</p>



<h3>Exchange Support:</h3>



<p>Ripple (XRP) is one of the most highly available currencies. Below is a list of high volume exchanges in rank from the highest to the lowest according to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/</a>. Exchanges must be listed and easily found on the company website.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.kraken.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraken(9th)</a><br><a href="https://www.bitstamp.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitStamp(13th)</a><br><a href="https://coinone.co.kr/exchange/trade/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoinOne(22nd)</a><br><a href="https://www.korbit.co.kr/market/xrp_krw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korbit(33rd)</a><br><a href="https://www.qryptos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qryptos(39th)</a></p>



<h3 id="WalletSetup">Wallet Setup Instructions:</h3>



<h5>iPhone and Android users:</h5>



<p>There&#8217;s a great application in the App Store called &#8220;Toast Wallet&#8221;. If you cannot find the toast application in the store you can download the application directly from the Toast website located here&nbsp;<a href="https://toastwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://toastwallet.com/</a><a href="https://coinomi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br></a></p>



<h5>PC Users:</h5>



<p>The wallets weren&#8217;t listed on Ripple, however if you navigate&nbsp; to <a href="https://toastwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ToastWallet.com</a>, there&#8217;s plenty of options. ToastWallet currently supports Windows 10, Mac OSX, Linux and even a chrome browser extension. Pretty impressive. After installation it will ask you to setup a pin number and a passphrase.</p>



<p>*(Windows 10 users with Sideloading error)<br><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro';">If you encountered an error during installation complaining about &#8220;side-loading&#8221; you will need to reconfigure your settings. Click on the search bar and type &#8220;settings&#8221;. Click on the gear icon that pops up. On the next screen labeled &#8220;windows settings&#8221;. Click on &#8220;Update &amp; Security&#8221; at the bottom of the screen.Click the button on the left hand side of the screen labeled &#8220;For Developers&#8221;. As a last step, click on &#8220;Sideload Apps&#8221;. The installer will work now with-ought any errors.</span></p>



<h5 id="NodeSetup">Supporting the Ripple (XRP) network by running a &#8220;Full Node Validator&#8221;:</h5>



<p>Detailed instructions on how to setup an online node validator are located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online node validator instructions</a>. Setting up a node is extremely complicated and is only meant for advanced users. The node can also stop being trusted for mischievous behavior or erroneous issues such as network failures. If your node is marked as being untrustworthy it will still reside on the network but if there&#8217;s any conflicting transactions the trusted nodes will take precedence. Below is a YouTube video explaining how to set up and contribute to the Ripple network:</p>

<h3>Opinion:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsDown-150x150.jpg" alt="I do not recommend this cryptocurrency" class="wp-image-101"/><figcaption>Not recommended &#8211; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTWRkwRSNmRFu-TVIeD9GFRH3nc3WqlozVr_GFQzEJc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Score Sheet!</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, this is one of the worst reviews I&#8217;ve ever done. If you&#8217;re new to crypto stay away from this one! I do have respect for all CryptoCurrencies since they have made the effort to produce something. Clam Coin almost doesn&#8217;t work and there&#8217;s extremely limited customer support. So, if you plan to use this cryptocurrency you&#8217;re on your own. Simple tasks such as downloading the wallet weren&#8217;t available on the homepage and I had to contact customer support to find the correct download link.</p>



<h2>Clam Coin Website:</h2>



<p><a href="http://www.clamcoin.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to navigate to the home page!</a></p>



<h3>Usability:</h3>



<p>The only helpful links I could find on the primary website &#8220;clamcoin.org&#8221; was a link to their customer support chat:&nbsp;<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=CLAMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for community support</a>. Everything else was either confusing or not working. Usually it takes a team to produce a product, in this case it takes a team to show a new user how to use it. In regards to using a full node wallet, I gave up after waiting for two weeks with practically no progress. I eventually downloaded the blocks off of another website. Sure, you can surf the internet searching for block downloads but that&#8217;s way beyond the scope of an average user. Since running a full node wallet is almost the only method to send and receive ClamCoins outside of exchanges, it makes ClamCoin almost completely unusable.</p>



<h3>Privacy:</h3>



<p>Clam coin uses the standard blockchain protocol with no enhanced privacy features.</p>



<h3>Credibility:</h3>



<p>Absolutely no credibility. While I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of people that have worked on ClamCoin, customer support couldn&#8217;t reference any of them in particular so needless to say there was no page listing the credentials.</p>



<h3>Innovation:</h3>



<p>Proof of stake (POS) is definitely a positive direction in the world of crypto currency. The Clam Coin team claims to be working on a lot of new features but given where the project is currently at it&#8217;s highly unlikely that any of these new features will happen.</p>



<h3>Customer Support:</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, the only reliable customer support that I&#8217;ve found is a user by the name of &#8220;tryphe_&#8221; that can be found at:.</p>



<p><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=CLAMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Support</a></p>



<h3>Exchange Support:</h3>



<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro';">Clam coin is listed on a three high volume exchanges and a one low volume exchange according to their home page. I gather my market data from CoinMarketCap.com located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/</a>. If it&#8217;s not listed on CoinMarketCap, it&#8217;s not eligible to be listed.</span></p>



<p>(High volume &#8211; listed in order)</p>



<p><a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-CLAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bittrex (12th) </a></p>



<p><a href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_clam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poloniex (19th) </a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=CLAM_BTC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptopia (49th)</a></p>



<p>(Low Volume)</p>



<p><a href="https://bleutrade.com/exchange/CLAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BleuTrade (137th)</a></p>



<h3>How to get started:</h3>



<p>After you have downloaded the wallet, &#8220;attempt&#8221; to sync by leaving your wallet online. If you would like to speed up the process, I&#8217;ve downloaded the blocks and made them available. Next you can use a free faucet to send coins to your address or purchase some currency on an exchange.&nbsp;Clam coins are earned if you hold a balance and leave your wallet online while running as a full node. Important Notice: If you held a balance on May 12th 2014 in a BTC, LTC,or DOGE address then you are entitled to the equal amount of Clam Coin.</p>



<h5>Download Wallet:</h5>



<p><a href="http://clamclient.com/start/download/" rel="noopener">Click here to download the wallet!</a></p>



<h5>Online wallets (N/A):</h5>



<p>None of the online wallets appear to be credible or working.</p>



<h5>Download wallet blocks from AltCoinAndMe.com:</h5>



<p>Close the ClamClient if it&#8217;s open. Make sure you&#8217;re able to show hidden files and folders in your file explorer. You can do this by opening a folder and clicking&nbsp; &#8220;View&#8221; in the toolbar and making sure &#8220;hidden items&#8221; is checked. Navigate on your computer to &#8220;C:\Users\(Your user name here)\AppData\Roaming\Clam&#8221;. Make sure to backup your wallet.dat file to a separate location to ensure you don&#8217;t lose any balances in your current wallet. Extract the contents of the following zip folder to the directory. Now start your clam client and enjoy.</p>



<p>Snapshot download:</p>



<p><a href="https://altcoinandme.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/ClamCoinSnapshot(3-7-2018).zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download blocks (3-7-2018)</a></p>



<h5>Free Clam Coin Faucets:</h5>



<p>The only legitimate Faucet I cold find is listed below.</p>

<h3>Overview:</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsUp-150x150.jpg" alt="Approved" class="wp-image-99"/><figcaption>Recommended &#8211; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Cfd9-24MQ7KJ8z7ABjEBvIO4TKRdUMcXB6hNKA7b9A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Score Sheet!</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Gridcoin offers rewards for donating your computer power to solving world issues such as cancer research, climate prediction, malaria control and even search for aliens! A full list of the amazing projects that reward GridCoin cryptocurrency are listed here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gridcoin.us/Guides/whitelist.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project WhiteList</a>.</p>



<h3>Opinion:</h3>



<p>I would highly recommend GridCoin because it has a highly stable and supportive community. The contributors believe in not just making money but helping the planet. Optionally, you can just leave your wallet online to earn a 1.5% APY.</p>



<h3>GridCoin Website:</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.gridcoin.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project HomePage</a></p>



<h3>Usability:</h3>



<p>The online wallet, phone wallet and PC wallet are easy to set up. If you would only like to send and receive GridCoin, scroll down to the section titled &#8220;online wallets&#8221;. However, if you wish to set up mining it&#8217;s a very complicated process. Unfortunately, I believe this is the only major issue with GridCoin. While as a programmer I might understand the steps, it&#8217;s very difficult for a standard user to begin mining. I&#8217;ve included a video in the section titled &#8220;Mining Setup Instructions&#8221; if you would like to learn how to mine. The developers should consider packaging everything in a bundle as a single installer.</p>



<h3>Privacy:</h3>



<p>GridCoin uses the standard blockchain protocol with no enhanced privacy features.</p>



<h3>Credibility:</h3>



<p>The website does not list any of the core developers. The team is located on a third party website located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://gridcoin.science/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project team</a>. It appears as if the primary developer has chosen to remain anonymous which is understandable but at least he&#8217;s being up front about it. The customer support commented that they would put in a request to get the team listed on the home page.</p>



<h3>Innovation:</h3>



<p>Amazing! This project is a one of a kind attempt to help scientist cure the worlds problems. Most people aren&#8217;t aware of the damage Bitcoin mining is making on the environment. If Bitcoin were a country it would rank 48th in the world for power consumption as you can see here: <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption</a>. The team addresses this issue by using that energy to help scientists. It&#8217;s a global effort, so do your best to get the word out.</p>



<h3>Customer Support (tested):</h3>



<p>Excellent customer support. Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact them about any questions you might have.&nbsp;All of my questions were quickly answered with polite and helpful answers. Although they are missing direct chat support there are plenty of other avenues you can use to contact them.</p>



<p>Direct chat support: N/A</p>



<p>Email: <a href="https://www.gridcoin.us/contact.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Page</a></p>



<p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gridcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct Chat</a></p>



<p>Discord:&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bt4YHxJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support Group</a></p>



<p>Telegram: <a href="https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@gridcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support Group</a></p>



<h3>Exchange Adoption:</h3>



<p>Gridcoin is supported by two high volume exchanges and one low volume exchange that are listed on their website. A high volume exchange is defined as ranking over 50th place in volume on https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/. The ranking from the highest volume to the lowest is Bittrex (11th), Poloniex (22nd) and C-Cex (115th).</p>



<h3>Mining Setup Instructions (optional):</h3>



<p>To mine I would suggest you watch the video below. If you would not like to mine scroll down to the section title &#8220;Wallet Setup Instructions&#8221;.<br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm2E6pQ-Ifw?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>



<h3>Wallet Setup Instructions:</h3>



<h5>Download Wallet:</h5>



<p>To run a full node wallet, Scroll to the bottom of: <a href="https://www.gridcoin.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the teams home page</a>&nbsp;and click on the wallet of your choice.</p>



<h5>Online wallets:</h5>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PC:</span><br>An online wallet is the easiest way to send and receive GridCoins. The online wallet is located here:&nbsp;<a href="https://gridcoins.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on their home page by clicking here!</a>.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Android:</span><br>Android users can use an application called &#8220;Coinimy&#8221; that supports GridCoin. Simply install the application from the Google Play Store and add the coin &#8220;GridCoin&#8221;. Please note that if you use the phone version you will not collect interest on your GridCoin(s).</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iPhone:</span></p>



<p>I was unable to find any support for the iPhone.</p>



<h5>Download wallet blocks using the GridCoin application:</h5>



<p>After the program has installed, double click on the GridCoin logo on your desktop. Once the client has loaded, click advanced on the toolbar, then click on &#8220;Download Blocks&#8221;.Click on &#8220;ok&#8221; and wait while the wallet brings it up to date.</p>



<h5>Free GridCoin CryptoCurrency&nbsp;Faucets:</h5>



<p><a href="http://uscore.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UScore</a>&nbsp;(highly recommended)</p>



<p><a href="https://gridcoinstats.eu/faucet.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCStats</a></p>



<p><a href="http://gridcoin.ch/faucet.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GC.ch</a></p>



<h5>Start collecting interest on your coins:</h5>



<p>You will need at least five GridCoin to start collecting interest. GridCoins are obtainable for free through the faucets, or you can purchase them through the exchanges. I would recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://uscore.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://uscore.net/</a>&nbsp;to obtain your original GridCoin because they&#8217;ll send you enough to get started. Once your wallet is online and up to date it will start collecting interest in 24-48 hours.</p>

<h2>Overview:</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://github.altcoinandme.com/altcoin-list/thumbsup/"><img src="https://github.altcoinandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ThumbsUp-150x150.jpg" alt="Recommended Cryptocurrency!" class="wp-image-99"/></a><figcaption>Thumbs Up!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Bitcoin Private (BTCP) is a truly anonymous cryptocurrency using a technology called [sg_popup id=&#8221;24&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]zk-snarks[/sg_popup] to conceal the sender and receivers addresse. Embedded in the wallet is also the ability to split up your transaction to assist in concealing the transaction amount.</p>



<h3>Opinion:</h3>



<p>Thumbs up. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Bitcoin Private is the next evolution of Bitcoin. We all should have a right to our privacy and with the new government regulations it&#8217;s being taken away! Do you feel like you missed out on Bitcoin in the early days? Here&#8217;s your chance. There&#8217;s major potential in the future because the privacy aspect is ground breaking. If you owned ZClassic or Bitcoin on February 28th, 2018 you are entitled to an equal amount of Bitcoin Private.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin Private Website:</h3>



<p><a href="https://btcprivate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to view their home page.</a></p>



<h3>Bitcoin Private Whitepaper (documentation):</h3>



<p><a href="https://btcprivate.org/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to view the WhitePaper!</a></p>



<h3>Usability:</h3>



<p>Not good. In comparison, it&#8217;s pretty complicated to set up. If you would like to run a full node wallet you will need to be familiar with Java which simply isn&#8217;t feasible for the average user. I do however have a solution in the section titled &#8220;Web Wallet&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t require Java.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this project is only in the infancy stage and I&#8217;m sure the team will introduce better installers in the future. I&#8217;ll make sure to keep this article update up to date with improvements.</p>



<h3>Privacy:</h3>



<p>Incredible. There&#8217;s nothing that comes close to the privacy features on Bitcoin Private. They&#8217;re using a method called &#8220;[sg_popup id=&#8221;24&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]zk-snarks[/sg_popup]&#8221;. [sg_popup id=&#8221;24&#8243; event=&#8221;click&#8221;]Zk-Snarks[/sg_popup] conceals the sender address, receivers address and other data from the public. It also features the ability to send a transaction and split it multiple times so that matching the senders amount with the receivers amount becomes exponentially difficult.&nbsp;Please note that you need to set up a private address within the wallet to take full advantage of privacy features Bitcoin Private offers</p>



<h3>Credibility:</h3>



<p>The team is fully transparent about who is working on the project. You can find a list of the team by clicking here:&nbsp;<a href="https://btcprivate.org/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Team</a>. The credibility and skills of the team are truly impressive including a roster of developers, marketers, designers and legal counsel.</p>



<h3>Innovation:</h3>



<p>Complete cutting edge technology. The speed of sending a transaction is 2-4 times faster than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Private is a pioneer in the cryptocurrency privacy arena. The team has also implemented something called BIP9. Due to BIP9, the future evolution of Bitcoin Private looks promising.</p>



<h3>Customer Support:</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m very unhappy to report that their customer support is non-existent. I was unable to get a response from their &#8220;live chat&#8221; button or any of the social media links. Attempts to contact the Bitcoin Private community support only resulted in insults. Attempting to ask a simple question about how to setup the wallet almost got me banned. I eventually got the support of a single user (thank you Timo) that was patient and led me through the pretend process of setting up a wallet..</p>



<h3>Exchange Support:</h3>



<p>Bitcoin Private is currently supported on three exchanges and is currently working on being listed in larger exchanges such as Binance. Binance announced that if the developers made some improvements they would support Bitcoin Private.</p>



<p><a href="https://tradesatoshi.com/Exchange?market=BTCP_BTC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TradeSatoshi</a></p>



<p>The only problem with the next exchange is that you can only trade the cryptocurrency &#8220;NANO&#8221; to gain BTCP.</p>

<h3>Wallet Setup Instructions:</h3>



<h4>Phone users:</h4>



<p>Download and install an App called Coinomi.</p>



<p>Android users click here:<br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet</a></p>



<p>iPhone users::<br>None available.<a href="https://coinomi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br></a><br>Click on create a new wallet. Write down the passphrase on the next screen. Click the checkbox and hit next. Confirm your passphrase by tapping on the correct words (you will only need to do this once), then click next. Now create a password (it must be at least 10 characters long). Congratulations, you have now setup Bitcoin Private on your phone. You can now browse the different features of the application.</p>



<h5>PC Users:</h5>



<h5>Online wallets:</h5>



<p>An online wallet is the fastest, easiest way to set up your own Bitcoin Private wallet. If you setup a lightweight wallet you do not need a full node wallet.</p>



<p>(Windows users)<br><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro';">Electrum is not technically an online wallet but it&#8217;s lightweight and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the difficulties of running a full node. You can download the Electrum wallet here:</span></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/BTCPrivate/electrum-btcp/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Electrum Wallet</a></p>



<p>Download a full node wallet:</p>



<p>Unfortunately setting up a wallet as a full node is only available using Java. I&#8217;ve attached a zip file with some modifications to make the process much simpler.</p>



<p>Step 1: Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.</p>



<p>Download and install Java:&nbsp;<a href="https://java.com/en/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://java.com/en/download/</a></p>



<p>Step 2:</p>



<p>(Windows only)</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken a few of the steps out of the process to help you with the installation and included them in a zip file located here:</p>



<p><a href="https://altcoinandme.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/BitcoinPrivateDesktopWallet_1.0.2_windows.zip" rel="noopener">Full node Installer</a></p>



<p>Simply extract the folder to your desktop and double click on the run.bat file located in the folder to start the wallet.</p>



<p>(Linux)</p>



<p>Download and follow the instructions here:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/BTCPrivate/bitcoin-private-full-node-wallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux GitHub instructions</a></p>



<h5>Download the wallet blocks using the Bitcoin Private wallet:</h5>



<p>The synchronization is extremely fast so just open the wallet and wait. If you&#8217;re running the Electrum wallet, it&#8217;s already up to date.</p>



<h5>Free Bitcoin Private CryptoCurrency&nbsp;Faucets:</h5>



<p>None yet, I&#8217;m sure there will be a few in the near future.</p>



<h3>Mining Setup Instructions:</h3>



<p>Bitcoin Private uses Equihash which is an algorithm that is only efficient to mine if you have a modern graphics card.</p>



<p>Below is a great video on how to get you started.</p>
